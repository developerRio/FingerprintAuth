# FingerprintAuth

Introduction :

This sample demonstrates how you can use system provided authentication.
This sample app implements challenge-response fashion of authentication for the online user authentication like PayTm or etc...
It uses device's fingerprint auth state, data & verifies the user credintials in seconds.

Limitations:

FingerprintManager is now deprecated and the apps need to implement the BiometricPrompt instead.
Project will be updated to BiometricPrompt as soon as Android studio gets 3.2 stable update.
